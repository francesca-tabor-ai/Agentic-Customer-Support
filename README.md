# Enterprise AI Support Platform

**Scale support with AI agents that learn, decide, and resolve—in real time.**

**Design:** Humanist sans-serif typography, minimal core palette (black / white / cool greys), signature gradient accents used sparingly. Developer-first, calm, confident—serious but not intimidating. See [Design System](docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) for full typography, colour, and branding guidelines.

## Transform how you handle customer support

The Enterprise AI Support Platform is a unified command center for AI-powered customer operations. Run multiple intelligent agents, manage tickets end-to-end, and see exactly how every conversation flows—so your team stays in control while automation handles the load.

- **Multi-agent orchestration** — Deploy and monitor AI agents in one place. Track active agents, queue depth, automation rates, and response times at a glance.
- **Full ticket lifecycle** — From intake to resolution: filter by status and priority, assign or escalate, search across history, and view threaded conversations in a single view.
- **Transparent AI workflows** — Visualize LangGraph execution flows step-by-step. See retrieval, tool calls, and decisions in real time so you can tune and trust your agents.
- **Analytics that drive decisions** — Automation trends, agent performance comparison, ticket volume and cost analysis, with custom date ranges for reporting and planning.
- **Knowledge base at the core** — Manage documents, embeddings, and retrieval metrics. Keep your agents accurate and up-to-date with a single source of truth.
- **Configurable and secure** — Tune agent parameters, choose LLM models, manage tools and integrations, and store API keys and credentials safely in a dedicated settings panel.

Built for teams who want **faster resolution**, **higher automation rates**, and **full visibility** into how AI supports their customers.
